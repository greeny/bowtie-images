The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is easy to understand and it
places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the framework. If the GPL
fits better to your project, you can use the framework under this license.

You don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You can freely
use BowtieImages in commercial projects as long as the copyright header
